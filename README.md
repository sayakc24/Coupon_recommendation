# Coupon_recommendation
End to end capstone project of Coupon recommendation 

This data was collected via a survey on the Ecom website Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the userâ€™s destination, gender, age, weather, passenger, coupon attributes, user attributes, and contextual attributes, and then asks the user whether he/she will accept the coupon or not.
Depending on the various features we are asked to analyse the data and then to apply machine learning model to predict whether a customer would accept the coupon or not.
